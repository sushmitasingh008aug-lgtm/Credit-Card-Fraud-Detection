# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using
machine learning classification techniques.

The project compares three machine learning models:

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost

The dataset is highly imbalanced, so SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling
Technique) is used to address the class imbalance in the training data.

## 🎯 Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

- Analyze credit card transaction data
- Understand the class imbalance between normal and fraudulent transactions
- Perform exploratory data analysis
- Apply feature scaling
- Handle class imbalance using SMOTE
- Train multiple machine learning classification models
- Evaluate and compare model performance

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used in this project was obtained from **Kaggle** and is the
**Credit Card Fraud Detection** dataset.

**Dataset Source:** [Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

The dataset contains transaction-related features including:

- `Time`
- `V1` to `V28`
- `Amount`
- `Class`

The `Class` column is the target variable:

- `0` → Normal transaction
- `1` → Fraudulent transaction

The dataset is not included in this repository because of its large size.
